# shopping-cart-project
## General Information
The purpose of this project is to create a shopping cart that can restock products using React. The restock feature pulls product data from a Strapi database.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would prompt the users of the to select what products need to be restocked. Eventtually I'd like to have this process be done automatically by the application.
